In this repository, I added code of my project in which I tried to build a web application that allows users to view all the restaurents and homes register on website and if user wants to explore restaurents then user can also make purchases along with all features we can access on other shopping apps such as add item to cart, buy now and show my orders etc.  On the other hand, if user select homes, then he can see all the information related to home and that location on home page and can also contact owner with the help of provided contact number or e-mail. The owner of restaurent and home can manage data of their owned property as they want and can answer to user queries along with accepting orders and all. So overall, I created this project by keeping in mind that user don't have to navigate different-different websites for all these things
